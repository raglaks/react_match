# Eyes

Eyes is a React web-app created for my web development bootcamp. To build it, I used React.js. It's a simple memory game that displays an array of images and when one is clicked, the images shuffle around. The objective is to click all of the images without clicking one twice. _(As I'm writing this, I have realized that I haven't included a "win" method to the game--probably because of how hard it is to win. If you actually win the game, please raise an issue and I will gladly fix the code. Good luck.)_

This was a very challenging build because I was completely new to React. But I learned a great deal about how powerful this library is for front-end development. Initially, I couldn't understand the importance of the state and props. I would try to hard code a state into each component, which obviously turned out disastrous. Once I began to read and fully understand React's clear documenation, I managed to slowly build the game.

One of my most important takeaways from this experience is the React Component Lifecycle. As most experienced React developers already know, the Component Lifecycle is a crucial part of React apps. There's a structure to what renders first and what re-renders when. But once you grasp this, creating React apps becomes a breeze.

Another conclusion from this build is that I have once again been drawn to front-end development. Throughout the middle and end parts of my bootcamp, I was heavily-drawn to back-end development because of Node.js and Express.js. I found Handlebars.js--a basic templating library that we used before learning React--very difficult and non-coder friendly. But React has opened a whole world of UX/UI potential to my short coding career. I hope to keep exploring it in future projects.
